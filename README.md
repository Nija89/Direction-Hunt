# Direction-Hunt

Direction-Hunt is a text-based location navigation game where players navigate through different locations with limited chances to find a hidden winning spot. The
game was built while practicing Java Map data structures, with each location and its possible exits represented as key-value pairs in a map. 
The game offers simple controls, and each decision impacts your remaining chances. Can you find the right path before your chances run out?



### How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Nija89/Direction-Hunt.git
   ```
2. Open the cloned folder in your IDE of choice.

3. Navigate to the `main.java` file.

4. Run the `main.java` file to start the application.


### How to Play
1. Start the Game: The game starts at the "START" location.
2. Move Between Locations: Youâ€™ll see the available directions you can take, such as UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.
     - You can type the direction in full (e.g., UP) or use a shorthand (U for UP, D for DOWN, etc.).
3. Win or Lose:
    - If you find the hidden location within the given chances, you win.
    - If your chances run out before finding the correct location, the game ends, and the correct location is revealed.
